*Latest native Battle System: four heroes, one towering opponent, and the language and tools behind the scene.*

**SMILE 2.0 is a programming language and game-development toolchain created by
Louiery R. Sincioco (Sin), with Codex collaboration.** It brings together a shared
language and semantic model, a native Windows compiler, rendering and audio
runtimes, reusable SMILE libraries, and Visual Studio integration.

Its current creative focus is **Sin Star I**, a science-fantasy RPG in development.
Much of the hands-on progress happens in the **3D Character Viewer and Animation
Editor**: bringing characters to life, refining equipment and poses, building
reusable effects, and turning party choreography into interactive battles.

**Development snapshot: September 24, 2026.** The thirteen Viewer and VFX Lab
screenshots on this page were captured from the native applications for this
update. The story illustrations and trailer below are separate creative-production
material. Sin Star I is a work in progress.

## Latest progress — the native Battle System

The Viewer now opens directly into a battle against **Kael**, with **Arin, Orin,
Zara and Mira** as the party. This latest slice adds playable decisions to the
existing character, animation and effects workflow:

- **Party orders:** select attacks, magic, healing targets, Defend, Limit Break or Run.
- **Automatic rounds:** repeat remembered orders, then request new ones at a round boundary.
- **Battle feedback:** HP, MP, Limit Break gauges, floating damage/healing and a crystal order pointer.
- **Progression:** EXP rewards, level growth, statistics tables and graphs for the current session.
- **Presentation:** a cinematic opening, action cameras, victory animations and automatic encounter restarts.
- **Hands-on inspection:** pause the battle while keeping smooth camera pan, orbit and zoom available.

The **Battle System** and **Kael Party** are distinct views: one runs interactive
combat; the other demonstrates the character choreography and effects.

## Earth Lab — giving Kael the power to move stone

**Boulder Hurl. Stone Volley. Fault Line.** The new native Earth Lab pairs Kael's
planted stances and two-handed casts with lifted rocks, flying fragments, dust,
impact cues and a reflective arena. His sword disappears during the cast so the
motion reads clearly, then returns for normal sword animation.

![Kael raises a boulder and loose stone in SMILE 2.0 Earth Lab](docs/images/readme/2026-09-24/earth-boulder-hurl.jpg)

*Boulder Hurl — body motion, stone lift and reflected geometry in the native renderer.*

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/readme/2026-09-24/earth-stone-volley.jpg" alt="Kael lifts several rocks for Stone Volley in the native Earth Lab"></td>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>Stone Volley</strong><br>Three successive thrusts send stone toward a selected target.</td>
    <td><strong>Fault Line</strong><br>A downward strike drives the effect across the arena.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is reusable SMILE code: the Earth effect owns rocks and dust independently
of Kael, while his adapter supplies animation timing and targets. The same casts
are already used in the native Viewer and Sin Star I's Kael presentations.

· [Inspect the shared Earth effect](libraries/Smile.Simple3D/EarthVfx3D.smile)

## Fire Lab — choreographing flame

**Ember Strikes. Flame Sweep. Inferno Blast.** The native Fire Lab connects
Kael's punches, sweeping kick and two-handed release to jets emitted from his
animated hands and foot. Bright flame cores, embers, heat distortion and cooling
smoke make each motion visible across the reflective arena.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/readme/2026-09-24/fire-inferno-blast.jpg" alt="Kael releases a wide Inferno Blast toward target pillars in the native Fire Lab"></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Inferno Blast</strong><br>A low lunge and two-handed release drive a broad jet toward the targets.</td>
    <td><strong>Ember Strikes</strong><br>Chambered punches send fire forward from the animated hands.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Lab also previews Arin's sword and shield flames and standalone effects such
as torches, fireballs and dragon breath. Playback can pause while the camera stays
active; quality, wind, turbulence and CPU/GPU controls support focused inspection.
Shared fire emitters own the effect resources, while character adapters provide
the attachment positions and attack timing.

**Current status:** Kael's three Fire attacks are native Lab previews. Their
adoption into his Character Viewer and Sin Star I battle rotations is pending.

## Water Lab — shaping flow and impact

**Water Whip. Serpent Orbit. Tidal Surge.** Water winds around Kael before
following his arm sweeps and torso turns toward a target. The native Water Lab
brings the animation, translucent water surfaces, spray and reflections together,
with a choice of standard and Realistic Water appearances.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/readme/2026-09-24/water-serpent-orbit.jpg" alt="Reflective water coils around Kael during Serpent Orbit with Realistic Water enabled in the native Water Lab"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="docs/images/readme/2026-09-24/water-tidal-surge.jpg" alt="Kael guides a curved water surge toward the target pillars during Tidal Surge in the native Water Lab"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Serpent Orbit</strong><br>Coiling water surrounds the caster, shown with Realistic Water enabled.</td>
    <td><strong>Tidal Surge</strong><br>A broad curved flow follows the cast before reaching the selected pillar.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Impacts can split around the smaller cylindrical targets and reunite behind them;
the largest target uses a crown splash. These are authored real-time effects with
explicit target bounds. The Lab also retains Mira's eight effect previews and
provides pause, 100 ms stepping, speed controls and a live clip clock for inspection.
Shared water modules own flow, impact geometry and spray independently of the actor.

**Current status:** Kael's three Water casts are already used in the native
Character Viewer and Sin Star I's normal/Earth/Water party rotation.

## Kael — from character package to elemental opponent

Kael's current native package brings together **sixteen animation clips**, a
silver-haired character, a fitted sword, and separate solo and boss presentations.
The Kael Party demo alternates sword attacks with Earth and Water casts, using
his own assets and timing.

| Element | Current native progress |
| --- | --- |
| **Earth** | Boulder Hurl, Stone Volley and Fault Line in Earth Lab, the Viewer and Sin Star I. |
| **Water** | Water Whip, Serpent Orbit and Tidal Surge in Water Lab, the Viewer and Sin Star I. |
| **Fire** | Ember Strikes, Flame Sweep and Inferno Blast in a separate Fire Lab preview; adoption into Kael's Viewer/game rotation is pending. |

· [Fire Lab](tools/AdvancedFireVfxLab/README.md)

## Vrax — a different kind of boss encounter

Vrax brings a mechanical silhouette, **24 animation clips**, six attack variants,
orange fire breath and blue-white arm lightning. His individual preview and party
encounter make it possible to inspect animation, targeting, effects and attack
sound cues in context.

## The Red Dragon — animation, fire and party reactions

The Red Dragon remains a living test of the whole scene: wings and claws,
head and mouth targeting, breath and fireball effects, defensive reactions,
and multiple independently animated heroes.

![The Red Dragon breathes fire toward the heroes, with the dragon, flame and party reflected in the native arena](docs/images/readme/2026-09-24/dragon-fire-breath.jpg)

*Fire breath in the native Viewer, paused for inspection with the camera still available.*

![Arin, Orin, Zara and Mira face the Red Dragon in the current native Party Dragon preview](docs/images/readme/2026-09-24/dragon-party.jpg)

*The current Party Dragon scene brings the four-character roster into the same shared arena.*

The dragon uses a lightweight preview rig. The goal is to make each animation,
attachment, effect and camera decision useful to the developing game, while
keeping the editor focused and responsive.

## Sin Star I — from script to screen

Sin Star I's development also reaches beyond the runtime: an illustrated script,
a visual storyboard, animated scene previews and video production explore the
characters, worlds and emotional stakes of the RPG.

The native game now lives at the root of the dedicated [Sin Star I repository](https://github.com/Sincioco/SinStarI),
which also contains the illustrated script, storyboard and production materials. Its current
storyboard has **122 illustrations across 53 scenes**, connected to script dialogue
and scene navigation. The local creative workspace also supports animated image
previews, clip variations and a Video Clips sequence-review view.

## What is being built underneath

The scenes above are the visible result of work across the full toolchain.

| Layer | What the repository demonstrates |
| --- | --- |
| **Language and compiler** | A shared lexer, parser, diagnostics, types and semantic model; readable BASIC-inspired source; native Windows compilation. |
| **Runtime and rendering** | Permanent 2D support alongside 3D characters, skeletal animation, materials, planar reflections, particles, input and audio. |
| **Reusable SMILE libraries** | Camera and arena controls, animation/equipment workflows, effects, UI and RPG systems with explicit state ownership. |
| **Visual Studio tooling** | SMILE projects, compiler integration, language services, templates and a VSIX. |
| **Asset and editing workflow** | Versioned character packages, grounding checks, sockets, timeline inspection and saved pose corrections for supported characters. |
| **Creative production** | Sin Star I's script, storyboard, character direction, scene previews and trailer. |

**Windows native development is priority one.** Web compilation is an existing
second target sharing the language front end. Recent native features shown here
must not be assumed to have reached Web: **all Web adoption, publication and
browser validation are on hold**.

### SMILE 2.0 Studio status

Studio has a bounded hosted Viewer and Character Editor using the shared Viewer
session. **Studio creation, development, final interaction acceptance and next
phases remain on hold.** The standalone Viewer and labs shown above are the current
working tools. General scene documents, reusable saved-effect/audio documents,
declarative scene authoring and faithful scene export remain planned.

The [accepted Studio architecture](docs/architecture/2026-09-09%20-%20SMILE%202.0%20Studio.md)
and [working visual design](docs/architecture/studio-visual-design.md) describe the
direction, not completed product capabilities. Future work resumes only on Sin's
direction; see the [Studio implementation status](tools/SmileStudio/README.md) and
[current adoption checkpoint](docs/implementation/party-beat-camera-checkpoint.md).

## Build and explore

The core Windows toolchain uses Windows components and Visual Studio tooling.
Start with **Windows 11 x64**, **PowerShell 7**, **.NET SDK 10.0.400** (selected by
`global.json`), and **Visual Studio 2026** with Desktop development with C++ and
Visual Studio extension development.

Check prerequisites, then build the compiler and extension:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\doctor.ps1
.\scripts\build.cmd
```

Primary outputs:

```text
artifacts\compiler\smilec.exe
artifacts\vsix\Smile.VisualStudio.vsix
```

For the native character workflow, follow the
[Viewer build and asset-preparation guide](tools/Character3DViewer/README.md#build-and-launch).
Some featured characters use locally licensed source assets that are not included
in Git; the guide explains the roster and preparation requirements. With those
prerequisites prepared:

```powershell
pwsh -File tools\Character3DViewer\Launch.ps1 -Build
```
